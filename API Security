Authentication: This security measure will be implemented to verify the identity of users before granting them access to the application. We will use token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to ensure that only registered and logged-in users can perform actions like booking a property or managing their listings.

Authorization: This determines the level of access a user has within the application. For instance, a user should only be able to edit their own profile or manage the properties they own, preventing unauthorized access to other users' data.

Rate Limiting: This will be implemented to prevent abuse of the API by limiting the number of requests a user can make in a certain period. This is crucial for protecting the application from denial-of-service attacks and ensuring fair usage for all users.
Importance of Security:

Protecting User Data: Securing user information, such as personal details and passwords, is paramount to building trust and complying with data protection regulations.

Securing Payments: Ensuring that all financial transactions are processed securely is critical to protecting users from fraud and ensuring the financial integrity of the platform.
